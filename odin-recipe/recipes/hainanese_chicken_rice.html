        <p>My favourite food of all time! Don't be fooled by the simple ingredients. The secret is in the broth: this is the most amazing, flavorsome Chinese chicken rice dish you've ever tried. Garnish with sliced cucumber, sprigs of spring onions, and cilantro.</p>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
            
        <p><strong>Step 1</strong></p>
        <p>Trim chicken of all excess fat, reserving fat.</p>
    
        <p><strong>Step 2</strong></p>
        <p>Place chicken, spring onion, 3 cloves crushed garlic, and one 1-inch piece ginger in a large pot. Pour in enough water to cover. Bring to a boil; reduce heat to low and simmer, skimming any scum off the surface, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone, reads 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), about 1 hour.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 3</strong></p>
        <p>Remove chicken from the pot, reserving broth. Rub chicken with salt. Chop into pieces and arrange on a serving plate.</p>
       
        <p><strong>Step 4</strong></p>
        <p>Combine soy sauce, 3 tablespoons reserved chicken broth, 1 1/2 tablespoon sugar, garlic oil, and sesame oil in a small bowl. Drizzle over chicken pieces.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Step 5</strong></p>
        <p>Melt reserved chicken fat in a large pot over medium heat. Add rice, 3 cloves minced garlic, crushed 1-inch piece ginger, and salt; cook and stir until rice is glossy and fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes</p>

        <p><strong>Step 6</strong></p>
        <p>Pour enough reserved chicken broth into the pot to cover rice by half an inch. Cover; bring to a boil. Cook until rice is tender and liquid is absorbed, 20 to 25 minutres. Let rice sit, covered, for 5 minutres. Fluff with a fork.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 7</strong></p>
        <p>Combine red chile peppers, juice of 2 limes, 2 tablespoons reserved chicken broth, 3 cloves garlic, one 1/2-inch piece ginger, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and 1 pinch sugar in a blender; blend until garlic chile dip is smooth. </p>

        <p><strong>Step 8</strong></p>
        <p>Combine juice of 2 limes, 2 tablespoons reserved chicken broth, 3 cloves garlic, one 1-inch piece ginger, and 1/8 teaspoon salt in a blender; blend until ginger dip is smooth.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 9</strong></p>
        <p>Serve garlic chile and ginger dips alongside chicken and rice.</p>

        <h1>Cook's Notes:</h1>
        <p>You can also prepare the rice in a rice cooker in step 6.</p>

        <p> The tangy garlic and ginger dips are traditionally part of the package, but you can omit them if you like.</p>
